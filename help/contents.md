# How to get help?

There are three ways to get help:

**Helpdesk (Programmeerbalie)** (online/on campus): You can book a slot to get to talk directly to an assistant. [Helpdesk info](/general-info/help#helpdesk)

**Lab sessions** (on campus): You'll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you're working on your assignments. [Lab info](/general-info/help#lab-sessions)

**Forum** (online): We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff. [Ed info](/general-info/help#ed)

## Schedule helpdesk and lab sessions

The new schedule can now be found in Datanose: [here](https://datanose.nl/#course[110669])

## Helpdesk

The helpdesk is the way to get one-on-one online help with your programming assignments.

* The helpdesk is available online.
* The helpdesk is available on many moments throughout the week.
* **You have to make an appointment**. You can make an appointment up to three days ahead, using this link: [Book Helpdesk](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/UniversiteitvanAmsterdam1@Amsuni.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/s/YkpwFIJMMkqDLSs-Fd-dhw2)
* Join us using this link: [Online Scientific Programming Lab](https://www.wonder.me/r?id=e57e2eb3-a410-4833-98f5-01b2d982d488)

## Ed

We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff.

* Use the forum: [Ed forum](https://edstem.org/us/courses/27745/discussion/).
* If you're not registered for Scientific Programming 1, but you're Scientific Programming 2 or Data Processing, you need to send an [email](mailto:scientific@mprog.nl) to get access to the forum.
* Please keep the language in English on the forum, as not all students following this course speak Dutch.
* When you use Ed, try to formulate your question clearly. Use code fragments to illustrate the problem. But, *never copy your entire code* here (this would make it too tempting for your fellow students to copy your code).

## Lab sessions

The lab sessions are the most classic way of getting help with your programming. You'll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you're working on your assignments.

* All these sessions take place on Science Park. Check [Datanose](https://datanose.nl/#course[110669]) for precise locations.
* This is a good place to work on your assignments and get immediate help.
* This is the main place where you can meet other students.
* There is no online version of this. If you want to work online, you can always use the helpdesk to talk to an assistant.
