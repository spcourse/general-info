# How to get help?

There are three ways to get help:

**Helpdesk (Programmeerbalie)** (online/on campus): You can book a slot to get to talk directly to an assistant. [Helpdesk info](/general-info/help#helpdesk)

**Lab sessions** (on campus): You'll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you're working on your assignments. [Lab info](/general-info/help#lab-sessions)

**Forum** (online): We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff. [Ed info](/general-info/help#ed)

## Helpdesk

* Help is both available on campus (at Science Park) and online.
* Help is available on many moments throughout the week.
* Whether you join online or join on campus, in both cases **you have to make an appointment**. You can make an appointment *up to one day ahead*, using this link: [book a slot](https://balie.mprog.nl/planner/4-scientific-programming)
* When you book a slot, clearly indicate if you plan to join "on campus" or "online".
    * If you choose to join online, use this link: [Online Scientific Programming Lab](https://www.wonder.me/r?id=e57e2eb3-a410-4833-98f5-01b2d982d488)
    * If you choose to join on campus check the schedule above for the location.

## Ed
We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff.

* Sign-up [Ed sign-on](https://canvas.uva.nl/courses/29103/external_tools/17562?display=borderless). You need to be registered for this course in SIS for this link to work. If you have a problem with this link, please send me an email: <scientific@mprog.nl>
* Use the forum: [Ed forum](https://edstem.org/us/courses/20047/discussion/)
* Please keep the language in English on the forum, as not all students following this course speak Dutch.
* When you use Ed, try to formulate your question clearly. Use code fragments to illustrate the problem. But, *never copy your entire code* here (this would make it too tempting for your fellow students to copy your code).

## Lab sessions
The lab sessions are the most classic way of getting help with your programming. You'll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you're working on your assignments.

* There are lab sessions on campus (Monday afternoon and Wednesday evening).
* All these sessions take place on Science Park. Check [Datanose](https://datanose.nl/#course[99564]) for precise locations.
* If you plan to go to a lab session please reserve a spot using this link: [booking](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/UniversiteitvanAmsterdam1@Amsuni.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/s/DMs1BphJ8U6A--L7PtN9tQ2). This is just to make absolutely sure in Covid times that there is enough space for everyone. If you cannot book a slot, please send me an email: <scientific@mprog.nl>.
<!-- * *Booking is not needed anymore. You can join these sessions whenever you want.* -->
* This is a good place to work on your assignments and get immediate help.
* This is the main place where you can meet other students.
* There is no online version of this. If you want to work online, you can always use the helpdesk to talk to an assistant.


### Lab session discussion subjects
You're always welcome to go to any of the lab sessions, no matter which assignment you're working on. You'll always be able to get individual help.

But, since a lot of people follow more or less the same schedule, we also will discuss some topics in small groups during the lab sessions. These sessions consists of small demos or discussions about a specific subject and will generally take around 15 to 20 minutes. The schedule below shows which subjects will be discussed and when.

If you're interested in being part of the discussion, please say so to the teacher at the start of the session.

Again, **if your pace doesn't match the schedule you're still encouraged to go to the labs!** You will always be able to get individual help there.

The schedule:
